Tamagotchi - Project 0 

MVP User Stories

- As a user, I want the tamagotchi to start feeling hunger, boredom, and tiredness when the game begins and as it progresses. and be able to be fed, played with, and put to sleep to lower those stats.

- As a user, I want the tamagotchi to be able to die whenever any of those three stats reach level 10.

- As a user, I want to interact with the tomagotchi through buttons to feed it, play with it, and put it to sleep.

What this is and Why it was made:

This is my first project everon github and in the GA program. I chose Kirby as the tamagotchi because he's probably the cutest creature ever. 


Tecnologies used:

-Jquery
-NES.css
-Press Start 2P font


Installation instructions: click on the link in the issues tab.


Unsolved problems:
- Couldn't get the button layout quite the way I wanted.
- Wanted to add more animations for Kirby, but I ran out of time.
- Also wanted to add progress bars for all of the stats, but time constraints again.
